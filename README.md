* An ontology for website classification based on interests
* This is different from most website classification ontologies as it is geared towards interests. For example, in many existing taxonomies a url that is simply "http://www.google.com" would be classified as "Web Search" and "http://www.bbc.co.uk/" would be "News". However, in this ontology those would both be "Uncategorized", because they reveal nothing about what the user is actually interested in. At the moment there are several categories that feel too non-specific (e.g. ['arts & entertainment', 'music']) that are being reconsidered. 
* Loosely based on the IAB taxonomy (http://www.iab.net/QAGInitiative/overview/taxonomy) but updated to be more international (e.g. removing "U.S. Government Resources") and more current (e.g. no "Palmtops/PDAs").
